# MOTHER v0 — build contract

Every part of v0 is built against this file. Change it first, then the code.

## 1. Two trees

**Plugin** (this repo, installed via `/plugin install mother@mother`):

```
.claude-plugin/plugin.json, marketplace.json
bin/mother                 CLI (Python 3, stdlib only): init, join, sync, scan, home, status, register
hooks/hooks.json           PreToolUse → hooks/guard.py; Stop + SessionEnd → `mother sync --quiet`
hooks/guard.py             approval guard (see §5)
skills/<name>/SKILL.md     user- and routine-facing skills, invoked as `mother:<name>`
routines/<id>.md           routine definitions: what a scheduled run does (reads config, calls skills)
assets/deck/               meeting deck template.html + build.py
rules/                     default policy text skills cite: outbound.md, privacy.md, memory.md, todos.md, projects.md, teams.md
templates/workspace/       files `mother init` copies into a new workspace
tests/                     stdlib unittest; `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
```

**Workspace** (one per manager, private; layout proven by the reference deployment):

```
config.json                §3 (JSON: the hook and CLI run on stock Python 3.9, which has no YAML/TOML parser)
capabilities.json          written by mother:doctor (§4)
AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md      the agent's persona + personal rules; CLAUDE.md is a pointer to AGENTS.md
memory/                    one fact per file + MEMORY.md index (frontmatter: name, description, metadata.type)
todos/open.md, archive.md  open loops, sections Yours / Mine / Blocked; items tagged `+<slug>`, origin `~manager@date` or `~agent/<src>@date`
projects/<slug>/PROJECT.md + files/     indexed by projects/PROJECTS.md
teams/<slug>/TEAM.md, roadmap.md, sprints/, meetings/, intake.md, metrics.md, runs.md   indexed by teams/TEAMS.md
people/<slug>.md           work items only, never assessments
journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md      nightly reflection
runs.md                    one line per routine run: `- <ISO> <routine> <ok|partial|failed> — <note>`
.mother/                   machine-local state, gitignored: home.lock, grants.json, ledger.json, last-sync
```

## 2. Finding each other

- `~/.mother/workspace` — one line: absolute path of the active workspace. Written by `mother init` / `join`.
  The hook, the CLI and every skill resolve the workspace from `$MOTHER_WORKSPACE`, else this file.
- Skills reference plugin files via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`; routines never hard-code a path.
- A registered scheduled task's prompt is a **thin pointer**:
  `cd "<workspace>" && run the mother:routine skill with id <id>`. Behaviour lives in `routines/<id>.md`.

## 3. `config.json` (schema v1)

See `templates/workspace/config.example.json` for a full example. Required keys:

| Key | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | int | `1` |
| `agent.signature` | str, optional | default below |
| `agent.name`, `agent.emoji`, `agent.manager`, `agent.manager_short` | str | signature `"{emoji} *{name} (AI)* · on behalf of {manager_short}"` |
| `manager.email`, `manager.timezone`, `manager.workdays`, `manager.chat_dm` | | `chat_dm` = the manager's DM channel/user id: the only always-allowed outbound target |
| `workspace.git_remote` | str or null | null = local only |
| `workspace.home_machine` | str or null | hostname allowed to run routines; null = routines refuse to run until set |
| `connectors.{chat,tracker,mail,calendar,code}` | str | `slack`/`teams`, `jira`/`linear`/`monday`/`none`, … |
| `teams[]` | list | `slug, name, tracker{project,board}, repos[], meetings{}, sprint{length,starts}, channels[], people[]` |
| `channels[]` (per team) | | `id, name, mode: off|watch|mention|draft|auto, trigger: manager|team|anyone, external: bool, quiet_hours, max_replies_per_hour` |
| `routines.<id>` | map | `at`, `days`, plus routine-specific options; absent = off |
| `policy` | map | defaults in `rules/outbound.md`; per-user overrides only tighten |

The CLI validates this (`mother status`) and fails loudly on unknown keys or a wrong type.

## 4. `capabilities.json`

```json
{ "checked_at": "2026-10-23T08:00:00Z", "host": "shays-mbp",
  "connectors": {
    "slack":   { "server": "<mcp server prefix>", "read": "ok", "post": "ok", "search": "missing_scope:search:read",
                 "private_history": "ok|missing", "token": "user|bot" },
    "jira":    { "server": "...", "read": "ok", "create": "ok|untested|denied", "transition": "...", "sprint": "..." },
    "calendar":{ "server": "...", "read": "ok" }, "mail": { ... }, "code": { "tool": "gh", "read": "ok" } } }
```

Values are `ok`, `untested`, `denied`, `missing_scope:<scope>`, `expired`, or `error:<short>`. A routine reads
this first and names any capability it needs that isn't `ok` in its output — never "nothing found".

## 5. Approval guard (`hooks/guard.py`)

Port of the reference deployment's `guard-outbound.py`, made config-driven:
- Matches outbound tools by **capability**, not server name: chat post/send/schedule, tracker create/update/
  transition/comment/sprint ops, mail send, calendar create/update with guests, `gh`/`glab` write commands.
- **allow**: posts to `manager.chat_dm`; mail drafts; calendar events without guests.
- **ask**: everything else outbound (the human confirms).
- **deny**: anything if `<workspace>/.mother/PAUSED` exists, and the `never` list (credential entry, deletions).
- Unattended routines may write only through a grant in `.mother/grants.json` that cites the manager's own
  message (channel, user = manager, ts) — scope-limited, count-limited, expiring, logged in `.mother/ledger.json`.
- Every decision is appended to `.mother/guard.log`.

## 6. Sync (`bin/mother sync`)

- No remote → commit locally only. Remote → `git add -A`, run `mother scan` (abort the whole commit and write
  `QUARANTINE.md` on any secret hit), commit `chore(sync): <ISO>`, `pull --rebase`, push; retry ×3 on reject;
  stop on conflict and say so. Never force-push.
- `mother home set|check|move` manages `workspace.home_machine`; `mother:routine` calls `home check` first
  and exits with a `runs.md` line when this isn't the home machine.

## 7. Skills in v0

`setup`, `doctor`, `routine` (dispatcher), `brief`, `digest` (team standup + decision queue), `dots`
(connect-the-dots), `meeting` (prep deck · meeting mode · apply results · recap), `reflect`, `todo`, `project`,
`team`, `remember`. Descriptions stay short and specific: they are matched against every request.

## 8. Writing rules for everything in this repo

- No company-specific names, IDs or hostnames. Examples use `example.com`, `PLAT`, `C00000001`.
- Python 3 stdlib only; shell only for one-liners. Tests for every CLI command and the guard.
- Outbound behaviour always goes through the guard; no skill posts around it.
